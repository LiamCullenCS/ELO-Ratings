# ELO-Ratings

Testing the analytical applications of a chess-based ELO ranking system on NFL teams. 

Below is the ELO rankings of all NFL teams after the 2018 nfl season.

I then graphed the results of the ELO rankings in a dotchart.

Next I'm going to compare the play distributions of every team and examine correlations between certain distributions and ELO ratings.

Here's an example of play distribution using the Seahawks

Stripped back play distribution vs league average
